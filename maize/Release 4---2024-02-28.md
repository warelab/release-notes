## Maize PanGenome Release 4.0
### Released: February 2024
## Summary
[Gramene's Maize PanGenome](http://maize-pangenome.gramene.org), a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on Maize crop varieties,
has now released a new version featuring the genome sequence and gene annotation of the teosinte inbred line **Til11**, also featured in the [MaizeCODE project](http://www.maizecode.org/data/). The site now hosts a total of 52 genomes including three assembly versions of the B73 _Zea mays_ reference (RefGen_v3, RefGen_v4, and RefGen_v5), 25 NAM maize founder genomes, 4 European flint genomes, 4 additional maize genomes, and seven outgroups (_Arabidopsis thaliana_, _Oryza sativa_ Japonica, _Sorghum bicolor_, _Vitis vinifera_ ssp. vinifera PN40024, _Selaginella moellendorffii_, _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_, and _Drosophila melanogaster_).

The maize gene models, together with the seven outgroups were used to build 35,360 protein-coding gene family trees. Data from 32 baseline gene expression studies from the EBI Expression Atlas, and 270 orthology-based pathway projections from the Plant Reactome are provided for B73 (v5).

The outgroup genome databases were built in direct collaboration with the [Ensembl Plants](http://plants.ensembl.org) project.
Other data sets were facilitated via collaborations with the [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments),
and the [Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/) databases.

## Overall Highlights {#overall-highlights}
- One new maize reference genome: Til11
- 35,360 protein-coding gene family trees from 1,674,759 protein sequences
- Additional gene expression and orthology-based pathway projections for the reference 
  genome *Zea mays* B73 v4 and v5
- MaizeCODE tracks: RNA (RNA-seq, RAMPAGE and shRNA-seq) and chIP-seq (H3K27ac, H3Kme3, H3K4me1) for the following four genomes: Til11, B73, NC350 and W22 in tissues including immature ears, endosperm, root tips, coleoptilar tips and pollen
- MaizeCODE tracks with TF chIP-seq data (GT1, HDZIV6, TU1A) for B73 in immature ears

## Comparative Genomics {#compara}

[**Gene Trees.**](http://maize-pangenome-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of
35,360 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by
the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each
of 1,628,071 individual genes (1,674,759 input proteins) from 42 plant genomes.

[**Synteny**](https://maize-pangenome-ensembl.gramene.org/compara_analyses.html). Fourty-one synteny maps between Zea mays B73 v5 and all other genomes in the panmaize browser.


## Expression {#expression}

Gene expression data for the Zea mays B73 genome reference was curated and
processed through the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments).
The set consists of 32 studies with baseline expression and 57 with differential expression. Baseline experiments
are available through our Gene Search (Expression panel) and Genome Browser; [differential experiments](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments?kingdom=Plants&species=Zea+mays&experimentType=Differential) are available at the Expression Atlas.

## Pathways {#pathways}

In this fourth release, we also feature 270 in v5 (271 in v4) orthology-based maize pathways associated with 1,769 genes in v5 (1,817 in v4) in the [Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/), the pathway knowledgebase. We utilize the Reactome pathway data model to represent plant metabolic, transport and signaling pathways, developmental processes, organ differentiation, and transcriptional regulatory networks. Manual biocuration is conducted in the reference _Oryza sativa_ Japonica species, and pathways are then projected via gene orthology to the B73 _Zea mays_ (pior reference), and other crops and model plants, lower plants and single-cell photoautotrophs.

## Funding {#funding}

Core funding for the project is provided by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA ARS 8062-21000-041-00D). The MaizeCODE project was funded via a National Science Foundation award #1445025.
