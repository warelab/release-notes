## Maize PanGenome Release 1.0
### Released: July, 2021
## Summary
[maize-pangenome.gramene.org](http://maize-pangenome.gramene.org), a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on Maize crop varieties,
has now released its first version. It provides access to 28 Maize reference genomes, including
the three most recent versions of B73 and 25 NAM founder lines, together with seven other species selected for comparative analysis.
Genome assemblies and annotations of the NAM founders are described in Hufford et al, 2021.
The genome databases were built in direct collaboration with the [Gramene](http://gramene.org) and
[Ensembl Plants](http://plants.ensembl.org) projects. Other data sets were facilitated via
collaborations with the [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments),
and the [Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/) databases.

## Overall Highlights {#overall-highlights}
- Maize reference genomes: B73 and the 25 NAM founder accessions were assembled and annotated (Hufford et. al. 2021).
- Six plant outgroup species (Japonica rice, B73 maize, Arabidopsis thaliana, grapevine,
  a vascular plant, and a single-celled green algae) and Drosophila melanogaster were
  used to build 31,412 protein-coding gene family trees from 1,276,195 protein sequences.
- We also have gene expression and orthology-based pathway projections for the reference 
  genome Zea mays B73.

## Comparative Genomics {#compara}

[**Gene Trees.**](http://maize-pangenome-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of
31,412 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by
the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each
of 1,276,195 individual genes (1,315,155 input proteins) from 34 plant genomes.

## Expression {#expression}

Gene expression data for the Zea mays B73 genome reference was curated and
processed through the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments).
The set consists of nine studies with baseline expression in B73 and 14 studies of differential expression.

## Pathways {#pathways}

269 orthology-based pathways associated with 1,216 Zea mays B73 genes.
These were projected from curated Japonica rice pathways and are linked to [Grameneâ€™s Plant Reactome](http://gramene.org/).
