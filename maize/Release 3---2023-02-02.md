## Maize PanGenome Release 3.0
### Released: March 2023
## Summary
[maize-pangenome.gramene.org](http://maize-pangenome.gramene.org), a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on Maize crop varieties,
has now released a new version featuring eight new maize genomes that include four [European flint maize genomes](http://www.europeanmaize.net/) (DK105, EP1, F7 and PE0075; Haberer et al, 2020), Mo17 (Sun et al, 2018), W22 (Springer et al, 2018), PH207 (Hirsch et al, 2016), A188 (Lin et al, 2021). The site now hosts a total of 43 genomes including three assembly versions of the B73 _Zea mays_ reference (RefGenv3, RefGen_v4, and RefGen_v5), 25 [NAM maize founder genomes](https://maizegdb.org/NAM_project), and seven outgroups (_Arabidopsis thaliana_, _Oryza sativa_ Japonica, _Sorghum bicolor_, _Vitis vinifera_ ssp. vinifera PN40024, _Selaginella moellendorffii_, _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_, and _Drosophila melanogaster_).

The maize gene models, together with the seven outgroups were used to build xxx31412xxx protein-coding gene family trees. Data from 25 baseline gene expression studies from the Expression Atlas, and 268/267 orthology-based pathway projections from the Plant Reactome are provided for B73 (v4/v5).

The genome databases were built in direct collaboration with the [Gramene](http://gramene.org) and
[Ensembl Plants](http://plants.ensembl.org) projects. Other data sets were facilitated via
collaborations with the [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments),
and the [Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/) databases.

## Comparative Genomics {#compara}

[**Gene Trees.**](http://maize-pangenome-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of
xxx31412xxx protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by
the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each
of xxx1276195xxx individual genes (xxx1315155xxx input proteins) from xxx34xxx plant genomes.

## Expression {#expression}

Gene expression data for the Zea mays B73 genome reference was curated and
processed through the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments).
The set consists of 25 studies with baseline expression and 55 with differential expression. Baseline experiments
are available through our Gene Search (Expression panel) and Genome Browser; [differential experiments](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments?kingdom=Plants&species=Zea+mays&experimentType=Differential) are available
at the Expression Atlas.

## Pathways {#pathways}

In this first release, we also feature 268/267 orthology-based maize pathways associated with xxx1540xxx genes in the [Plant Reactome](http://gramene.org),
the pathway knowledgebase. We utilize the Reactome pathway data model to represent plant metabolic, transport and
signaling pathways, developmental processes, organ differentiation, and transcriptional regulatory networks. Manual
biocuration is conducted in the reference species rice (Oryza sativa Japonica) and pathways are then projected via gene
orthology to the B73 _Zea mays_ (pior reference), and other crops and model plants, lower plants and single-cell photoautotrophs.
