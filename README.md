# release notes and genome pages
## release notes
Release notes for each gramene subsite are in their own directory.

Each release note file has to have a specific format `<name>---YYYY-MM-DD.md`

If the date is in the future, it will not be shown on the subsite.

## genome pages
For genome pages, they are expected to be in the `<subsite>-genomes` directory and have the same format restrictions as for release notes
