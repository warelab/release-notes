## Define BLAST {#define-blast}

The Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) allows researchers to find regions of similarity between biological sequences. The program compares nucleotide or protein sequences to sequence databases and calculates the statistical significance. 

Check out [NCBI's page for BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). 

## Go to the BLAST page of SorghumBase {#go-to-blast}

The direct URL for the SorghumBase knowledgebase is [https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Tools/Blast](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Tools/Blast).

Here are other ways to intituitively get to the same page:

1) Select BLAST from the TOOLS drop-down menu on the SorghumBase homepage.

![BLAST from the Tools drop-down menu](images/blast_sorghum_top_menu.png)

2) Click on the Tools icon on the SorghumBase homepage, and subsequently click on the BLAST icon

![BLAST icon at bottom of SorghumBase's homepage](images/blast_tools_front_bottom_icon.png)

3) There is also a BLAST link in the header of each page in the genome browser site.

4) On browser pages that display a sequence such as [the cDNA page for SORBI_3006G108000](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Transcript/Sequence_cDNA?db=core;g=SORBI_3009G229800;r=9:57038653-57041166;t=KXG22524), the sorghum ortholog of rice <i>dw2</i>, click the button to BLAST this sequence.

## BLASTing a gene's nucleotide sequence {#blast-job}

From the above [the cDNA page for SORBI_3006G108000](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Transcript/Sequence_cDNA?db=core;g=SORBI_3009G229800;r=9:57038653-57041166;t=KXG22524), let's click on "BLAST this sequence". This will automatically pre-fill the "Sequence data" field with the DNA sequence of the <i>dw2</i> ortholog, pre-select "Sorghum bicolor" by defalt as the species to search against, and "Genomic sequence" as the DNA database of choice,  as shown in the image below.

Please note that "Sorghum bicolor" refers to the BTx623 reference genome, but users may select other species in the database to blast against, including all the sorghum variants hosted in SorghumBase. To select species to search against, click on the corresponding check box, as shown for the Sorghum bicolor reference in the image below. Other species selected (maize and rice in this example) will appear on the right column. To remove a species from the blasting universe to search against, simply click on the "minus sign" (-) to the right of each species name.

Currently, DNA databases to choose from are:

* Genomic sequence
* Genomic sequence (hard-masked)
* cDNAs (transcripts/splice variants)
* Non-coding RNA genes

There is only one protein database to choose from (Proteins).

The algorithms that may be used for BLASTing DNA are BLASTN and TBLASTX. While BLASTN searches a nucleotide sequence in a DNA sequence database, TBLASTX compares the six-frame translations of a nucleotide query sequence against the six-frame translations of a nucleotide sequence database.

BLASTX is the only algorithm available to search a protein sequence in the avaialble proteins database.

Sensitivity for the Search is set to "Normal" by default. Other options are "Near match" and "Distant homologies", whcih are more stringent and more relaxed, respectively.

Otther parameters that may be used to fine-tune a BLAST search fall under the categories of "General", "Scoring", and "Filters and masking". Under general options, users may specify a maximum number of alignments or scores displayed, and a threshold for the e-value.  Under scoring options, a dropoff score may be specified (this value is used to calculate the highest scoring pairs between two sequences) together with a match/mismatch score, a penalty for opening or extending a gap, the option of performing alignment using gaps, as well as the option to filter low complexity regions under filter and masking.

Hit the "Run" button to initiate your BLAST job or "clear" if you wish to attempt a new search.

If you have used BLAST recently, at the bottom of the page, you will see a section for "Recent jobs".
