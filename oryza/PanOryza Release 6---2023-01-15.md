## Overall Highlights

New to this release are new and updated 3K SNP data called by [KAUST](https://cda.kaust.edu.sa/) using GATK4 for Nipponbare, MH63, IR64 and Azucena.
Having variation data called on these additional genomes provides additional coverage of genetic variation in regions not present in the Nipponbare reference genome.

A new search feature has been added by indexing curated gene annotations from RAP-DB and NCBI's geneRIF. These resources include publications detailing the functions of over 4000 rice genes.


## Databases 
### Comparative Genomics

No updates in the current release, please see [release notes for version 5.0](https://oryza.gramene.org/News?section=PanOryza%20Release%205).

### Variation

3K SNP variation data for Nipponbare, MH63, IR64 and Azucena, called by scientists at the [Center for Desert Agriculture at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, KAUST](https://cda.kaust.edu.sa/) using the Genome Analysis Toolkit [GATK4](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us).

20,483 Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) were remapped to the IRGSP-1.0 assembly by industry collaborator [KeyGene](http://www.keygene.com). Of those, 19,435 were taken from [Gramene's legacy QTLs database](http://archive.gramene.org/qtl), and 1,048 from the [Q-Taro database](http://qtaro.abr.affrc.go.jp).
