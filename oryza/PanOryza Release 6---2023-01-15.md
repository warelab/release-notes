## Overall Highlights

New to this release are updated 3K SNP data called by [KAUST](https://cda.kaust.edu.sa/) using GATK4 for Nipponbare, MH63, IR64 and Azucena.
Having variation data called on these additional genomes provides additional coverage of genetic variation in regions not present in the Nipponbare reference genome.
A new search feature has been added by indexing curated gene annotations from RAP-DB and NCBI's geneRIF. These resources include publications detailing the functions of over 4000 rice genes.
