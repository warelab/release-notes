## Oryza PanGenome Release 4
### Released: May 2022
## Summary

Gramene's Oryza Pan-Genome (https://oryza.gramene.org) is a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on rice varieties. In its fourth release, three new rice genomes were added to the portal: 

* _Oryza sativa indica_ XI-adm var. MH63 (Zhou _et al_, 2020)

* _Oryza sativa indica_ XI-1A var. ZS97 (Zhou _et al_, 2020)

* _Oryza sativa japonica_ var. KitaakeX (Jain _et al_, 2019)

The rice pangenomes collection now amounts to a total of 28 Oryza genomes. Together with the genomes of _Leersia perrieri_ (the most closely related species to the Oryza in the Oryzeae tribe), 6 plant outgroups (B73 maize, sorghum, Arabidopsis thaliana, grapevine, a vascular plant, and a single-celled green algae) and Drosophila, a total of 37,423 GeneTree families were constructed comprising 1,134,514 individual genes (1,187,461 input proteins) in order to allow comparisons between higher eukaryotes, lower plants, and the model Arabidopsis. See updated stats [here](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html).


Core funding for the project was provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF IOS-1127112) and the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA ARS 8062-21000-041-00D).

## Overall Highlights {#overall-highlights}

Our comparative genomics collection was updated to include a total of 37,423 protein-coding gene family trees using Ensembl Compara software (Herrero _et al_, 2016). The new trees were constructed with 1,187,461 input proteins from 1,134,514 individual genes from the 28 Oryza genomes, _L. perrieri_, and 7 outgroup species (Arabidopsis thaliana, sorghum, grapevine, Chlamydomonas, Selaginella, B73 maize in assembly versions 4 and 5, and Drosophila).


## Databases {#databases}
### Comparative Genomics

[**Gene Trees.**](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of 37,423 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each of 1,134,514 individual genes (1,187,461 input proteins) from 36 genomes.
