## Oryza PanGenome Release 5
### Released: October 2022
## Summary

Gramene's Oryza Pan-Genome (https://oryza.gramene.org) is a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on rice varieties. In its fifth release, we are providing synteny maps between rice varieties and across closely related crops, whole-genome alignments between the rice reference assembly, sorghum and maize, new links to the Oryza Search page from the Ensembl Gene pages, and updated display names for the rice genomes.

## Overall Highlights

New to this release are 27 new synteny maps between the IRGSP1 Nipponbare assembly and all rice accessions, as well as new cross-species synteny maps between the Nipponbare assembly and Leersia, sorghum and maize. In addition, whole-genome alignments between Nipponbare, sorghum and maize are being provided. Usability of the site has been improved through direct links from the Ensembl Browser Gene pages to the Oryza Search pages. Nomenclature for naming of reference sequence assemblies was updated based on standard recommendations from the NSF-DBI (#2029854): CIBR-BBSRC: PanOryza: Globally coordinated genomes, proteomes and pathways for rice.


## Databases 
### Comparative Genomics

[**Whole-Genome Alignments**](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/compara_analyses.html). New pairwise alignments between the Nipponbare, and the sorghum and maize genomes. See [example](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_sativa/Location/Multi?align=23;db=core;r=1%3A8950777-9114776:-1;s1=Sorghum_bicolor;s2=Zea_maysb73).

[**Synteny**](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/compara_analyses.html). Twenty-seven synteny maps between the IRGSP1 Nipponbare assembly and all rice accessions (for example, see [Nipponbare vs KitaakeX](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_sativa/Location/Synteny?db=core;otherspecies=Oryza_sativakitaake;r=1:8950777-9114776), and three new synteny maps between the Nipponbare and each of Leersia, sorghum and maize. See the same region of [Nipponbare compared to sorghum](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/Oryza_sativa/Location/Synteny?db=core&r=1%3A8950777-9114776&otherspecies=Sorghum_bicolor).
