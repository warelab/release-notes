**_Vitis vinifera _PanGenome**

This user guide refers to the contents of the first public release (August 2021) of the Grape PanGenome. Currently, the PanGenome hosts 18 genomes including 20 _Vitis vinifera_ genomes, 2 versions of the _Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera PN40024_ reference* (Jaillon _et al_, 2007; Vitulo _et al,_ 2014; Canaguier _et al_, 2017; Rustenholz _et al_, manuscript in preparation), and 7 outgroups (_Arabidopsis thaliana_, _Oryza sativa _Japonica, _Sorghum bicolor, Vitis vinifera ssp. vinifera PN40024, Selaginella moellendorffii_, _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_, and _Drosophila melanogaster_).

At present, most data types are only available for the _PN40024 _reference version 3, so this guide will focus on the phytochrome B gene model (PHYB), using its v3 gene identifier: VIT_05s0077g00940.

Let’s begin!

Go to [http://vitis.gramene.org/](http://vitis.gramene.org/)

Locate the search box at the top left corner of the page. Type a search term (gene, species, pathway, ontology term, protein domain, etc.). For the exercises below, we will focus on searching for the grape PHYB gene or VIT_05s0077g00940.

**Querying a_ _Gene**

Let’s start by typing “PHYB” in the search box and observe the auto-completion suggestions that pop-up as you type, as well as the various data categories in which the potential results are organized.
