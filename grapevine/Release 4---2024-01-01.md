## Vitis PanGenome Release 4.0
### Released: January 1, 2024
## Summary
The Vitis PanGenome, a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on grapevine varieties, has released its fourth version. It provides access to 31 grape reference genomes, together with seven other species selected for comparative analysis. The genome databases were built in direct collaboration with the [Gramene](http://gramene.org) project. Gene expression and orthology-based pathway association is available for the grapevine, _Vitis vinifera_ PN40024 reference v3 via the Search functionality, and were facilitated through collaborations with the [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments), and the
[Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/) databases. Core funding for the project is provided by the National Sciene Foundation ([NSF IOS-1127112](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1127112) and the Agricultural Research Service of the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](http://www.usda.gov/) (USDA ARS 8062-21000-041-00D) to the Ware Lab at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. 

We would like to thank the grapevine research community, especially the VitisGen2 (https://www.vitisgen2.org; USDA NIFA SCRI 51181-26829) and the EU-COST action CA 17111 (http://www.integrape.eu) collaborators for generously sharing their data, making valuable contributions, and providing feedback on the site. The genomes sequenced by the VitisGen2 are also available at [grapegenomics.com](http://www.grapegenomics.com) hosted by the Cantu Lab at the University of California in Davis.

- Six plant outgroup species (Japonica rice, B73 maize, Arabidopsis thaliana, grapevine, a vascular plant, and a single-celled green algae) and Drosophila melanogaster were used to build XX protein-coding gene family trees.

These family trees were constructed with XX input proteins from XX individual genes. Pairwise DNA alignments and synteny maps are available for version 3 of the Pinot noir PN40024 reference in the [Gramene website](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Vitis_vinifera/Info/Index).

- Gene expression and orthology-based pathway projections are available for version 3 of the PN40024 grape reference genome via the Search interface.

- BLAST alignments are also available for all 25 genomes in the Vitis pangenome portal.
  

## Databases {#databases}
### Comparative Genomics

[**Gene Trees.**](https://vitis-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of 27,620 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each of 841,363 individual genes (885,518 input proteins) from 25 plant genomes.

[**Whole-Genome Alignments**](https://ensembl.gramene.org/info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html). 76 pairwise genomic alignments are available for version 3 of the Pinot noir PN40024 reference assembly in the [Gramene website](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Vitis_vinifera/Info/Index). New alignments across the grape genomes will be made available here in future releases.

[**Synteny**](https://ensembl.gramene.org/info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html). Eight synteny maps are available for version 3 of the Pinot noir PN40024 reference assembly in the [Gramene website](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Vitis_vinifera/Info/Index). New synteny maps across the grape genomes will be made available here in future releases.


### Variation

Genetic variation is available for version 3 of the Pinot noir PN40024 reference assembly in the [Gramene website](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Vitis_vinifera/Info/Index) for will be available in future releases. Genetic variation data sets will be made availale here in future releases.

### Expression

Gene expression data for the PN40024 grape v3 genome reference was curated and processed through the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments). The set consists of 10 studies with baseline expression and 23 differential expression studies.

### Pathways

269 orthology-based grape pathways associated with 1,076 grapevine PN40024 v3 genes. These were projected from curated Japonica rice pathways and are linked to [Gramene’s Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/PathwayBrowser/#/SPECIES=9030216).
