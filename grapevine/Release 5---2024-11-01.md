## Vitis PanGenome Release 5
### Released: November 2024
## Summary
The Vitis PanGenome, a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on grapevine varieties, has released its fifth version. It provides access to 29 grape reference genomes including two assemblies of _Vitis vinifera_ ssp. _vinifera_ clone PN40024 (v3 and v4), three wild sylvestris varieties, 10 non-vinifera Vitis species, and 8 non-grape species (_Arabidopsis thaliana_, _Chlamydomonas reinhardtii_, _Oryza sativa_ _Japonica_ Nipponbare, _Selaginella moellendorffii_, _Solanum lycopersicum_, _Sorghum bicolor_ ssp. _bicolor_ BTx623, _Zea mays_ B73, and _Drosophila melanogaster_, selected for comparative analysis. The genome databases were built in direct collaboration with the [Gramene](http://gramene.org) project. Gene expression and orthology-based pathway association is available for the grapevine, _Vitis vinifera_ PN40024 reference v4 via the Search functionality, and were facilitated through collaborations with the [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments), and the [Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/) databases. The genomes sequenced by the VitisGen2 project are also available at [grapegenomics.com](http://www.grapegenomics.com) hosted by the Cantu Lab at the University of California in Davis.

Core funding for the Gramene Vitis PanGenome project is provided by the Agricultural Research Service of the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](http://www.usda.gov/) (USDA ARS 8062-21000-051-00D) to the Ware Lab at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. We would like to thank the grapevine research community, especially the VitisGen project (currently as [VitisGen3](https://vitisgen3.umn.edu/); USDA NIFA SCRI 2022-51181-38240), [INTEGRAPE](https://integrape.eu/) (EU COST Action CA17111) and [GRAPEDIA](https://grapedia.org/) (partly funded by a COST Innovators Grant) collaborators for generously sharing their data, making valuable contributions, and providing feedback on the site.

## Overall Highlights {#overall-highlights}

- Eight plant outgroup species (tomato, Japonica rice, B73 maize, Arabidopsis thaliana, grapevine, a vascular plant, and a single-celled green algae) and Drosophila melanogaster were used to build 33,275 protein-coding gene family trees. Tomato, a fleshy fruit, is being included for the first time in this release of the Gramene Vitis PanGenome.

- Our comparative genomics collection includes a total of 33,275 phylogenetic trees, of which 16,065 are grapevine specific. These family trees were constructed with 1,337,885 input proteins from 1,288,848 individual genes. Pairwise DNA alignments for version 4 of the Pinot noir PN40024 reference and _Arabidopsis thaliana_ are available in the [Gramene website](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Vitis_vinifera/Info/Index).

- Gene expression and orthology-based pathway projections are available for version 4 of the PN40024 grape reference genome via the Search interface.

- BLAST alignments are also available for all 37 plant genomes in the Vitis pangenome portal.

### Comparative Genomics

[**Gene Trees**](https://vitis-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html). A total of 33,275 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each of 1,288,848 individual genes (1,337,885 input proteins) from 36 plant genomes.

[**Whole-Genome Alignments**](https://ensembl.gramene.org/info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html). Pairwise genomic alignments is available for version 4 of the Pinot noir PN40024 reference assembly and _Arabidopsis thaliana_. New alignments across the grape genomes will be made available here in future releases.

[**Synteny**](https://ensembl.gramene.org/info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html). Synteny maps across all grape genomes and the PN40024 v4 reference will be made available in future releases.


### Variation

Over 300K SNPs identified by re-sequencing a collection of grape cultivars and wild Vitis species from the [USDA germplasm collection](http://www.ars.usda.gov/Main/docs.htm?docid=12254) (Myles et al, 2010) were remapped to version 4 of the Pinot noir PN40024 reference assembly and assigned unique standard rsIDs.

### Expression

Gene expression data is now available for the PN40024 grape v4 genome reference was curated and processed through the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments). The set consists of 10 studies with baseline expression and 23 differential expression studies.

### Pathways

268 orthology-based pathways were projected from curated Japonica rice pathways to _Vitis vinifera_ v4 and linked to [Grameneâ€™s Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/PathwayBrowser/#/SPECIES=9030216). The pathways are associated with 1,304 grapevine PN40024 v4 genes.
