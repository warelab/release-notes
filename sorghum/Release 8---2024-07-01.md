## SorghumBase Release 8.0
### Released: August 2024

SorghumBase (https://www.sorghumbase.org) is a USDA-ARS funded resource released to the public in 2021. The SorghumBase team works closely with the community to support stewardship of sorghum genomics data, establish best-practices on managing the data, and provide opportunities for networking and capacity building within the community. We maintain a database of scientific publications, genome sequences, gene structure annotations, and comparative genomic analyses integrated with curated data from [EBI's Gene Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments), [Bio-Analytical Resources' eFPseq browser](https://bar.utoronto.ca/), [Gramene's Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org), and [OZ Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/sorghum-qtl-atlas/).


## Summary

In its eight release, SorghumBase (SB) features 46 new _Sorghum bicolor_ ssp. _bicolor_ breeding lines with an expired Plant Variety Protection (ex-PVP) Act certificate sequenced by a team led by Dr. Michael Todd at the Salk Institute and two T2T genome assemblies (BTx623 and ...) to a total of 88 sorghum genomes and XXX sorghum genes. Moreover, a total of 66,928 sorghum pan-genes created using annotations from 28 sorghum genomes in SB release 7 were mapped to each of the 46 ex-PVP accessions by a team led by Dr. Doreen Ware at CSHL. 

We are also providing variation sampled with nearly 23 million additional variants. The set by [Kumar and colleagues (2024)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/24501) consisted of 19.7 million single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and 2.7 million insertion deletions (indels) assesed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in 365 accessions including 332 individuals from the bioenergy association panel (BAP). The [Lasky et al (2015)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/24502) set consisted on characterizing 1943 georeferenced landraces at 404,627 SNPs.

In addition, a large genotyping data set from the Gates-funded [Global Sorghum Initiative](https://www.globalsorghuminitiative.org/) was provided by Dr. Nadia Shakoor from the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Dr. John Lovell from the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, and Dr. Geoff Morris from Colorado State University. The set consists of 36.1 million SNPs called in 940 resequenced genomes, and is mapped to the JGI_V5.1 assembly, which is subject to the [Fort Lauderdale accord](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/fortlauderdalereport.pdf) restrictions.

In an effort to harmonize germplasm identifiers within SorghumBase and based on the recommendation of best practices used by the community and curators of major sorghum germplasm repositories such as GRIN and ICRISAT, we provide all genotyping data using standard germplasm identifiers (e.g., PI and IS numbers) and standard SNP identifiers (e.g., rsIDs). 

Besides genomic resources, SorghumBase provides weekly updates of news items, conferences, community events and funded research projects. Our publications database now includes 1,026 sorghum papers, 13 of which have been [highlighted in News posts](https://www.sorghumbase.org/posts?categories=research-highlights) including an article co-authored by members of the SorghumBase Team describing the high-quality chromosome-scale genome assemblies of inbred lines Tx2783 and RTx436 [(Wang et al, 2024)](URL). News items and project pages are indexed and searchable, and include information on how to access related data on SorghumBase. A recently updated [user guide](https://www.sorghumbase.org/guides) is available from the site and feedback may be provided via a [contact form](https://www.sorghumbase.org/contact). Individual training sessions may be scheduled upon request. Please check the upcoming [events](https://www.sorghumbase.org/events) on the latest webinars, conferences, meetings, etc. relevant to the sorghum research community. You are always welcome to [contact us](https://www.sorghumbase.org/contact), if you are interested in hosting a training event, collaborating with the SorghumBase team, would like to provide feedback or ask questions. 

Funding for the project is provided by the Agricultural Research Service of the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](http://www.usda.gov/) (USDA ARS 8062-21000-051-00D).

## Release Contents -- Databases

### Genomes & Gene Annotations

This release includes a total of 88 sorghum assemblies including two versions of BTx623 (NCBIv3 and 5.1 from Phytozome, which was released under the [Fort Lauderdale Accord](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/fortlauderdalereport.pdf) for restricted use prior to publication), and seven plant outgroup species. See [release notes for version 6.0](https://www.sorghumbase.org/relnotes?section=Release%206) for more details. 


### Variation

Standard rsID identifiers assigned by the EVA were mapped to approximately 41 million SNPs in both BTx623 assemblies, NCBIv3 and JGIv5.1.

**BTx623 (NCBIv3)**

Over 78 million sorghum variants _(how many unique?)_ including more than 65 million naturally occurring Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) _(how many unique?)_ genotyped in almost 900 accessions, and almost 13 million chemically-induced variants (i.e., ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutations) in a mutagenized population BTx623 background. This data includes the following studies:

== Natural variation ==

* [Kumar et al (2024)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/24501) - 19.7M SNPs and 2.7M indels, whole-genome sequencing 365 accessions (including 332 BAP)
* [Lasky et al (2015)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/24502) - 405K SNPs, 1943 georeferenced landraces
* [Boatwright et al (2022](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/20741) - 33M SNPs and 5M indels genotyped by sequencing 400 SAP lines
* [Lozano et al (2021)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/comparative-evolutionary-genetics-of-deleterious-load-in-sorghum-and-maize) - nearly 13M SNPs, 499 sorghum accessions from the TERRA-MEPP, TERRA-REF population panels, and lines previously genotyped by [Mace et al (2013)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/21275)

== Chemically-induced mutagenesis screens ==

* [Jiao et al (2023)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/23165) - 8.6 million EMS-induced mutations, 890 lines
* [Addo-Quaye _et al_ (2018)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/19942) and [Jiao _et al_ (2016)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/a-genomic-resource-for-the-development-improvement-and-exploitation-of-sorghum-for-bioenergy); and 5,843 sorghum QTLs for 148 sorghum traits from the [Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/).

41 million rsIDs were mapped from EVA release 5 (July 2023) to the genetic variants in sorghum BTx623 NCBIv3. In the near future, we aim to have rsIDs assigned to all naturally occuring variants for BTx623 in SorghumBase.

**BTx623 (JGI_v5.1)**

* 36.1M SNPs, 940 resequenced sorghum genomes from the [Global Sorghum Initiative](https://www.globalsorghuminitiative.org/)

The [Global Sorghum Initiative](https://www.globalsorghuminitiative.org/) is founded by the Gates Foundation. Libraries for the 940 genomes were resequenced using Illumina HiSeq X10 and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 paired-end sequencing (2 × 150 bp) at HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology and aligned to the BTx623 reference with BWA-mem. The resulting .bam file was filtered for duplicates using Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) and realigned around indels using GATK 3.056. Multi-sample SNP calling was done using SAMtools mpileup and Varscan V2.4.089 with a minimum coverage of eight, a minimum alternate allele count of four, and a minimum minor allele frequency of 0.001. The full 2144-library VCF was subsetted to the Gates Foundation samples using bcftools 1.9.

Approximately 41 million BTx623 rsIDs from EVA release 5 (July 2023) were remapped from NCBIv3 to JGI_V5.1 _(how many do map to a Gates variant?)_.

***BTx623 rsIDs mapped to other sorghum accessions***

Nearly 41 million standard rsIDs were mapped from BTx623 (NCBIv3) to the 46 ex-PVP breeding lines resequenced by the team lead by Dr. Michael Todd of the Salk Institute.
