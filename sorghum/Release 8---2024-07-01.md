## SorghumBase Release 8.0
### Released: August 2024

SorghumBase (https://www.sorghumbase.org) is a USDA-ARS funded resource released to the public in 2021. The Sorghumbase team works closely with the community to support stewardship of sorghum genomics data, establish best-practices on managing the data, and provide opportunities for networking and capacity building within the community. We maintain a database of scientific publications, genome sequences, gene structure annotations, and comparative genomic analyses integrated with curated data from [EBI's Gene Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments), [Bio-Analytical Resources' eFPseq browser](https://bar.utoronto.ca/), [Gramene's Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org), and [OZ Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/sorghum-qtl-atlas/).

***Genetic & Phenotypic Variation***

- Sorghum BTx623 (JGI_V5.1)

1) 36.1M SNPs called in 940 resequenced genomes from the Gates-funded [Global Sorghum Initiative](https://www.globalsorghuminitiative.org/) - Sorghum Genomics Toolbox. This data was the result of an effort led by Dr. Nadia Shakoor at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, Dr. John Lovell at the Hudson Alpha Institute for Biotechnology, and Dr. Geoff Morris at Colorado State University. This genotyping data was provided in JGI version 5.1 (JGI_V5.1) genomic coordinates. JGI_V5.1 is subject to the [Fort Lauderdale accord](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/fortlauderdalereport.pdf) restrictions by which publication of articles containing analyses of genes or genomic data on this chromosome-scale assembly prior to publication of a comprehensive genome analysis by JGI and/or its collaborators. 

**Important note**: The approximately 41 million SNP variants (without their respective genotypes) with standard rsIDs in the Sorghum BTx623 NCBIv3 assembly, have also been mapped to JGI_V5.1. All genotyping data and corresponding frequencies for those variants continues to be available from the [Sorghum BTx623 NCBIv3 assembly browser](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Info/Index).

KAPPEEL, SHARON --> 2) SNPs called in the 46 ex-PVP lines in an effort led by Dr. Michael Todd of the Salk Institute and Dr. Nadia Shakoor at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center? (Then rsIDs mapped to the 30 (of the 46 ex-PVP breeding lines?). _Removing this: "rsIDs mapped to the pangennomes or QTLs mapped from BTx623 via rsIDs"_
  
***Regulation***

- Sorghum BTx623 (NCBIv3)

- ATAC-seq & Chip-seq data from [Lou et al, 2019](https://sorghumbase.org/paper/24376) for sorghum, maize, rice and barley.


### New Functionality

- SorghumBase's Search Results enhancements:
  
- 73 sorghum papers added to the [Publications](https://www.sorghumbase.org/publications) database with 13 of them described in more detailed in [research highlights](https://www.sorghumbase.org/posts?categories=research-highlights). Corresponding title, abstract, authors, keywords, PubMed id, and doi are searchable.

- 16 funded projects for Sorghum research have been added to the site and integrated into the site-wide search to a total of 305. A [Projects](https://www.sorghumbase.org/projects) page shows a map of institutions involved, and a searchable table of awards. Each project has its own page with basic information from the funding agency; we invite PIs to work with us to enrich their project pages to include links to publications, blog entries, project web pages, etc.

## Release Contents -- Databases

### Genomes & Gene Annotations

This release includes a total of 89 sorghum assemblies including two versions of BTx623 (NCBIv3 and 5.1 from Phytozome, which released under the [Fort Lauderdale Accord](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/fortlauderdalereport.pdf) for its restricted use prior to publication), and seven plant outgroup species. See [release notes for version 6.0](https://www.sorghumbase.org/relnotes?section=Release%206) for more details. 

### Variation

**BTx623 (NCBIv3)**

Update R7 contents as needed: 

Over 59 million sorghum variants including more than 46 million naturally ocurring Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped in almost 900 accessions, and almost 13 million chemically-induced variants (i.e., ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutations) in a mutagenized ppopulation BTx623 background.

New: 940 resequenced sorghum genomes [Global Sorghum Initiative](https://www.globalsorghuminitiative.org/) founded by the Gates Foundation. Data relative to https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Sbicolor_v5_1.

Sequencing methods: Libraries were resequenced using Illumina HiSeq X10 and Illumina NovaSeq 6000 paired-end sequencing (2 Ã— 150 bp) at HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology and aligned to the Btx623 reference with BWA-mem. The resulting .bam file was filtered for duplicates using Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard) and realigned around indels using GATK 3.056. Multi-sample SNP calling was done using SAMtools mpileup and Varscan V2.4.089 with a minimum coverage of eight, a minimum alternate allele count of four, and a minimum minor allele frequency of 0.001. The full 2144-library VCF was subsetted to the Gates Foundation samples using bcftools 1.9.

Note: Acc samples are from the Ethiopian IBC collection from Taye Tadesse at EIAR. Apparently those genotypes are not currently publicly available.
