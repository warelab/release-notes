The SorghumBase Team is pleased to announce Release 1 providing access to information on XX reference genomes and XXX gene family trees. We are adding X new reference genomes, including â€¦. With these new genomes, our comparative genomics collection has reached a total of N pairwise DNA alignments and N synteny maps. We have also added X, Y datasets for xxx.

Followed by Genomes Table, variation summary, split genes counts?  pathways/ expression? etc
