## SorghumBase Release 3.0
### Released: March 2022
## Summary
[SorghumBase](https://www.sorghumbase.org/), a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on sorghum crop varieties, has now released its third version. This release #3 features over 17 million new genetic variants, including naturally occurring SNPs ([Lozano _et al_, 2021](https://sorghumbase.org/paper/comparative-evolutionary-genetics-of-deleterious-load-in-sorghum-and-maize)) and chemically induced point mutations ([Addo-Quaye _et al_, 2018](https://www.sorghumbase.org/post/an-improved-high-resolution-method-for-the-in-silico-detection-of-ems-induced-mutations-in-sorghum-mutant-populations-2)). In addition, over 1.7 million EMS-induced mutations in the 252 M4 mutant pools previously described by [Jiao _et al_ (2016)](https://sorghumbase.org/paper/a-sorghum-mutant-resource-as-an-efficient-platform-for-gene-discovery-in-grasses) were recalled for this set. With these new and updated data sets, our collection of genetic variation totals over 24 million variants including nearly 6,000 QTLs from the Sorghum QTL Atlas. The release continues to provide access to a total of 18 sorghum genomes, and 7 other species to support phylogenetic analyses, and cross-species comparisons. The genome and genetic variation databases were built in direct collaboration with the [Gramene](http://gramene.org) and [Ensembl Plants](http://plants.ensembl.org) projects. Other data sets were facilitated via collaborations with the [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments),
the [Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/), and the [Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/) databases. Core funding for the
project is provided by the Agricultural Research Service of the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](http://www.usda.gov/) (USDA ARS 59-8062-9-002).

## Overall Highlights {#overall-highlights}

**New Data**

   * **[Lozano _et al_ (2021)](https://sorghumbase.org/post/Comparative-Analysis-of-Deleterious-Mutations-in-Sorghum-versus-Maize)** – Nearly 13 million naturally occurring SNPs in 499 sorghum accessions (includes 14 duplicate samples). Included are accessions from the TERRA-MEPP and TERRA-REF population panels, and lines previously genotyped by Mace _et al_ (2013).

- **[Addo-Quaye _et al_ (2018)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/post/an-improved-high-resolution-method-for-the-in-silico-detection-of-ems-induced-mutations-in-sorghum-mutant-populations-2)** – Over 2.6 million point mutations identified in 486 sorghum accessions corresponding to the M3 generation of an EMS-mutagenized sorghum population.


**Updated Data**

- **[Jiao _et al_ (2016)](https://sorghumbase.org/paper/a-sorghum-mutant-resource-as-an-efficient-platform-for-gene-discovery-in-grasses)** – Over 1.7 million EMS-induced mutations recalled in 252 M4 mutant pools.


**Other Updates and Highlights**

- Improved look and feel of the website. Check out our [Events page](https://www.sorghumbase.org/events).
- A modest increase in relevant sorghum papers in our [Publications](https://www.sorghumbase.org/publications) database.


We continue to host 18 sorghum genomes, protein-coding gene trees, whole-genome alignments, genetic, structural and phenotypic variation, gene expression and orthology-based pathway projections for the reference genome *S. bicolor* BTx623.


## Databases {#databases}
### Comparative Genomics

[**Gene Trees.**](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of
30,475 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by
the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each
of 796,813 individual genes (836,223 input proteins) from 25 plant genomes.

[**Whole-Genome Alignments**](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/compara_analyses.html).
There are five pairwise genomic alignments for five sorghum genomes against
Japonica rice (see [version 2 release notes](https://www.sorghumbase.org/relnotes).

### Variation

Genetic variation data sets for over 17 million sorghum single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) (Morris _et al_, 2013; Mace _et al_, 2013) and 1.5 million chemically
induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) point mutations (Xin _et al_, 2008); 27,884
structural variants (Zheng _et al_, 2011) from the [Database of Genomic Variation Archive](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/)
(DGVa); and nearly 6,000 QTLs from the [Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/).

### Expression

Gene expression data for the S. bicolor BTx623 genome reference was curated and
processed through the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments).
The set consists of seven studies with baseline expression in BTx623 (Davidson _et al_,
2012; Makita _et al_, 2014; Wang _et al_, 2018; Emms _et al_, 2016; Turco _et al_, 2017; and
two unpublished studies with SRA projects SRP062564 and SRP029353). At the Expression
Atlas site, baseline expression is also available for a bioenergy sorghum genotype
R.07020 (Kebrom _et al_, 2017), and differential expression for three studies 
(Varoquaux _et al_, 2019; Dugas et al 2011; Gelli et al, 2014), including one 
(Dugas _et al_, 2011) in the BTx623 reference.

For the baseline studies in SorghumBase, sampling was done in a single site
(e.g., stem internode), a discrete cell type (e.g., bundle sheath, leaf mesophyll),
organism parts (including seed, spikelet, stem, leaf, flag leaf, inflorescence, pistil,
embryo, endosperm, anther, pericarp, pollen, root, shoot, floral meristem, flower,
vegetative meristem, vascular/ non-vascular system) or the whole organism, at one or
multiple developmental stages. For example, Wang and collaborators (Wang _et al_, 2018)
examined 11 matched tissues of maize B73 and sorghum BTx623 at different developmental
stages for gene expression profiling totalling 165 experimental assays.

### Pathways

269 orthology-based sorghum pathways associated with 1,248 S. bicolor BTx623 genes.
These were projected from curated Japonica rice pathways and are linked to [Gramene’s Plant Reactome](http://gramene.org/).
