## SorghumBase Release 9.0
### Released: December 2024

SorghumBase (https://www.sorghumbase.org) is a USDA-ARS funded resource released to the public in 2021. The SorghumBase team works closely with the community to support stewardship of sorghum genomics data, establishes best-practices on managing the data, and provides opportunities for networking and capacity building within the community. We maintain a database of scientific publications, genome sequences, gene structure annotations, and comparative genomic analyses integrated with curated data from [EBI's Gene Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments), [Bio-Analytical Resources' eFPseq browser](https://bar.utoronto.ca/), [Gramene's Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org), and [OZ Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/sorghum-qtl-atlas/).


## Summary

In its ninth release, SorghumBase (SB) features 12 new _Sorghum bicolor_ ssp. _bicolor_ genomes including two telomere-to-telomere (T2T) assemblies of BTx623 ([Li _et al_, 2024](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/24530); [Deng _et al_, 2024](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/24194)) to a total of 85 sorghum cultivars (88 assemblies).  

We are also providing variation sampled by the Gates-funded **Sorghum Genomics Toolbox** (SGT) Project (also known as the [Global Sorghum Initiative](https://www.globalsorghuminitiative.org/)) remapped to NCBIv3. This set consists of (36.1 - _check # successfully remapped_) million SNPs called in 940 resequenced genomes.

In an effort to harmonize germplasm identifiers within SorghumBase and based on the recommendation of best practices used by the community and curators of major sorghum germplasm repositories such as GRIN and ICRISAT, where available, we provide genotyping data using standard germplasm identifiers (e.g., PI and IS numbers) and standard SNP identifiers (e.g., rsIDs). 
  
The Germplasm tab of the results of a gene query now includes variants that cause the loss of a gene's function (LOF) from 46 ex-PVP breeding lines and Search results are now grouped and tallied by species.

Accessions with genetic variants causing the LOFs are now organized by study or population, type of variant (e.g., stop gained/lost, frameshift, splice acceptor/donor) and homozygous/heterozygous state in the Germplasm tab of the gene.

Besides genomic resources, SorghumBase provides weekly updates of news items, conferences, community events and funded research projects. Our publications database now includes 1,147(UPDATE from 1,026) sorghum papers, 30(UPDATE from 13) of which have been [highlighted in News posts](https://www.sorghumbase.org/posts?categories=research-highlights) since the last SB release in October. News items and project pages are indexed and searchable, and include information on how to access related data on SorghumBase. A recently updated [user guide](https://www.sorghumbase.org/guides) is available from the site and feedback may be provided via a [contact form](https://www.sorghumbase.org/contact). Individual training sessions may be scheduled upon request. Please check the upcoming [events](https://www.sorghumbase.org/events) on the latest webinars, conferences, meetings, etc. relevant to the sorghum research community. You are always welcome to [contact us](https://www.sorghumbase.org/contact), if you are interested in hosting a training event, interested in collaboration with the SorghumBase team or would like to provide feedback or ask questions. 

Funding for the project is provided by the Agricultural Research Service of the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](http://www.usda.gov/) (USDA ARS 8062-21000-051-00D).

***Genetic & Phenotypic Variation***

- Sorghum BTx623 (NCBIv3)

  * 36.1 million SNPs from the Gates-funded [Global Sorghum Initiative](https://www.globalsorghuminitiative.org/) called in 940 resequenced genomes using the JGIv5 assembly (see [release notes for version 8.0](https://www.sorghumbase.org/relnotes?section=Release%208)) were lifted to the NCBIv3 assembly. 

  * 41 million rsIDs were mapped from BTx623 v3.1 to 16 sorghum accessions: ausTRCF317961, IS19953, Ji2731, R93194522, Chinese Amber, IS36143, PI525695, Rio (PI651496), Tx436, 353, IS12661, IS929, PI532566, PI536008, S3691, and Tx2783.


### New Features

* Search results are now grouped and tallied by species. In other words, the lowest common ancestor in the taxonomy tree for all of the genes that are associated with a suggestion is appended after the number of hit genes for a query.


### New Papers & Funded Projects

- 121 sorghum papers were added to the [Publications](https://www.sorghumbase.org/publications) database with 30 of them described in more detail in [research highlights](https://www.sorghumbase.org/posts?categories=research-highlights). Corresponding title, abstract, authors, keywords, PubMed id, and doi are searchable.

- 35 funded projects for Sorghum research were added to the site and integrated into the site-wide search to a total of 340. The [Projects](https://www.sorghumbase.org/projects) page shows the location map of institutions, and a searchable table of awards based on  PI, agency, award dates etc. Each project has its own page with basic information from the funding agency. We invite PIs to work with us to enrich their project pages to include links to publications, blog entries, project web pages, etc.


## Release Contents -- Databases

### Genomes & Gene Annotations

This release includes a total of 85 sorghum assemblies including four versions of BTx623: NCBIv3, JGIv5.1 (restricted under the [Fort Lauderdale Accord](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/fortlauderdalereport.pdf), and two T2T assemblies in addition to seven plant outgroup species. See [release notes for version 6.0](https://www.sorghumbase.org/relnotes?section=Release%206) for more details. 


### Variation

Standard rsID identifiers assigned by the EVA were mapped to nearly 41 million SNPs in both BTx623 reference assemblies (NCBIv3 and JGIv5.1), as well as all other sorghum genomes including the 46 ex-PVP breeding lines. In addition, rsIDs were also assigned to Japonica rice and B73 maize SNPs.


**BTx623 (NCBIv3)**

Over XX (78) million sorghum variants including more than XX (65) million naturally occurring SNPs genotyped in over 4,450 [_CHECK_] accessions, and almost 13 million chemically-induced variants (i.e., ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutations) in a mutagenized population BTx623 background. This data was sourced from the following projects:

_Note_: 41 million rsIDs were mapped from EVA release 5 (July 2023) to the genetic variants in sorghum BTx623 NCBIv3. In the near future, we aim to have rsIDs assigned to all naturally occuring variants in BTx623 in SorghumBase.


**BTx623 (JGI_v5.1)**

* 36.1M SNPs, 940 resequenced sorghum genomes from the [Sorghum Genomics Toolbox](https://www.globalsorghuminitiative.org/) (Global Sorghum Initiative).


***BTx623 rsIDs mapped to other sorghum accessions***

Nearly 41 million standard rsIDs from EVA release 5 (July 2023) were mapped from BTx623 (NCBIv3) to every genome in SorghumBase. [_Confirm this holds true for 74+11, what about multiple versions of BTx623?_]


***Loss of function mutations***

Germplasm with LOF mutations among all sorghum accessions is now available from the Gramene search.
