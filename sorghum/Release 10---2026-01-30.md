## SorghumBase Release 10
### Released: January 2026

SorghumBase (https://www.sorghumbase.org) is a USDA-ARS funded resource released to the public in 2021. The SorghumBase team works closely with the community to support stewardship of sorghum genomics data, establishes best-practices on managing the data, and provides opportunities for networking and capacity building within the community. We maintain a database of scientific publications, genome sequences, gene structure annotations, and comparative genomic analyses integrated with curated data from [EBI's Gene Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments), [Bio-Analytical Resources' eFPseq browser](https://bar.utoronto.ca/), [Gramene's Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org), and [OZ Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/sorghum-qtl-atlas/).


## Summary

In its tenth release, SorghumBase (SB) features 31 new _Sorghum bicolor_ ssp. _bicolor_ genomes from [JGI](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/). The site now hosts a total of 116 sorghum genome assemblies. Protein-coding gene family analysis constructed 49,455 gene trees from 2,487,060 input gene models representing 68 sorghum and 8 outgroup genomes. Standard identifiers for genetic variation (rsIDs) assigned by the European Variation Archive (EVA) to variants called on BTx623 v3 have been projected to 100 other sorghum assemblies. This resource allows traits to be anchored to stable identifiers and accessed in a pan-genome context.

In an effort to harmonize germplasm identifiers within SorghumBase and based on the recommendation of best practices used by the community and curators of major sorghum germplasm repositories such as GRIN and ICRISAT, where available, we provide genotyping data using standard germplasm identifiers (e.g., PI and IS numbers) and standard SNP identifiers (e.g., rsIDs). 

In the Germplasm tab of the gene search page, accessions with genetic variants causing the Loss of Functions (LOFs) are now organized by study or population, type of variant (e.g., stop gained/lost, frameshift, splice acceptor/donor) and homozygous/heterozygous state.

Besides genomic resources, SorghumBase provides weekly updates of news items, conferences, community events and funded research projects. Our publications database now includes over 1,500 sorghum papers, a subset of which have been [highlighted in News posts](https://www.sorghumbase.org/posts?categories=research-highlights). News items and project pages are indexed and searchable, and include information on how to access related data on SorghumBase. A recently updated [user guide](https://www.sorghumbase.org/guides) is available from the site and feedback may be provided via a [contact form](https://www.sorghumbase.org/contact). Individual training sessions may be scheduled upon request. Please check the upcoming [events](https://www.sorghumbase.org/events) on the latest webinars, conferences, meetings, etc. relevant to the sorghum research community. You are always welcome to [contact us](https://www.sorghumbase.org/contact), if you are interested in hosting a training event, interested in collaboration with the SorghumBase team or would like to provide feedback or ask questions. 

Funding for the project is provided by the Agricultural Research Service of the [U.S. Department of Agriculture](http://www.usda.gov/) (USDA ARS 8062-21000-051-00D).

## Release Contents -- Databases

### Genomes & Gene Annotations

This release includes a total of 88 sorghum assemblies including four versions of BTx623: NCBIv3, JGIv5.1 (restricted under the [Fort Lauderdale Accord](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/fortlauderdalereport.pdf), and two T2T assemblies in addition to seven plant outgroup species. See [release notes for version 6.0](https://www.sorghumbase.org/relnotes?section=Release%206) for more details. 


### Variation

Standard rsID identifiers assigned by the EVA were mapped to nearly 41 million SNPs in both BTx623 reference assemblies (NCBIv3 and JGIv5.1), as well as 46 ex-PVP breeding lines, and 25 other sorghum genomes (see Variation column in the [Species Table](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/species.html) for a complete list. In addition, rsIDs were also assigned to Arabidopsis, Japonica rice and B73 maize SNPs.


**BTx623 (NCBIv3)**

Over 78 million sorghum variants including more than 65 million naturally occurring SNPs genotyped in over 4,450 accessions, and almost 13 million chemically-induced variants (i.e., ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutations) in a mutagenized population BTx623 background. This data was sourced from the following projects:

### Expression

There are updates on the gene expression data in the curent release. Now the SorghumBase has total 16 bulk expression studies, consisting of 11 studies with baseline expression and 5 with differential expression gene expression data for the _S. bicolor_ BTx623 (NCBIv3) genome reference curated and processed through the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments). The Paralogs tab allows the users to select the baseline or differential study to provide the expression of paralogs for the selected reference study and generates the heatmap. These are available through our Gene Search (Expression panel).  
Data for the eFP browser on the Expression tab of the SorghumBase search results have also been updated form one studies to 10 expression studies. It provides maps based on tissue, developmental stages, and stress conditions.
