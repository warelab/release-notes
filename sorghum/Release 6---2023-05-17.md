## Databases
### Comparative Genomics

[**Gene Trees.**](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of
N protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by
the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each
of X individual genes (X input proteins) from 36 plant genomes.

[**Synteny**](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/compara_analyses.html).
83 synteny maps between each of the sorghum genomes in SorghumBase (including BTx623 v3 but not the recently updated BTx623 v5), and maize B73 v5 or Japonica rice IRGSPv1, and sorghum BTx623 v3 and each of the other 27 sorghum varieties. [Synteny map for sorghum BTx623 v3 at chr4:61,032,110-61,070,283 and the maize B73 subgenomes](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Location/Synteny?db=core;otherspecies=Zea_maysb73;r=4:61032110-61070283) - MAY NEED TO UPDATE LINK TO SPECIFY IT'S V3.

[**Whole-Genome Alignments**](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/compara_analyses.html).
There are pairwise genomic alignments for each one of the following sorghum genomes against Japonica rice, Arabidopsis TAIR10, or maize B73 v5:

- [_Sorghum bicolor_ ssp. _bicolor_ BTx623 v3](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Location/Compara_Alignments/Image?align=1;db=core;otherspecies=Zea_maysb73;r=4:41625307-41663480;time=1668636258419.419) - MODIFY URL?

### Variation

Needs UPDATE

Genetic variation data sets are available as about 61 million sorghum variants including
almost 51 million SNPs (44 million of which plus 5 million indels genotyped by sequencing
in the SAP lines [Boatwright _et al_, 2022](https://www.sorghumbase.org/post/whole-genome-sequencing-of-400-sorghum-association-panel-sap-accessions-establishes-a-crucial-resource-for-dissecting-genomic-diversity-in-sorghum)), 
4.3 EMS-induced mutations [(Addo-Quaye _et al_, 2018)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/19942) and [(Jiao _et al_, 2016)](https://sorghumbase.org/paper/a-sorghum-mutant-resource-as-an-efficient-platform-for-gene-discovery-in-grasses), 
and nearly 6,000 QTLs for 220 sorghum traits from the [Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/).

### Expression

Gene expression data for the _S. bicolor_ BTx623 genome reference was curated and
processed through the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments). No other updates since release 2.

### Pathways

Orthology-based sorghum pathways for _S. bicolor_ BTx623 projected from curated Japonica rice pathways by [Grameneâ€™s Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/). No other updates since release 2.

### Curated Publications

Our database of sorghum research papers has grown to N publications. The integrated search interface includes matching papers when searching by author, keywords, pubmed ID, or any other text within the title or abstract. 
Publications in the database can be linked to news items and funding sources, for example: [Boatwright _et al_(2021)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/post/whole-genome-sequencing-of-400-sorghum-association-panel-sap-accessions-establishes-a-crucial-resource-for-dissecting-genomic-diversity-in-sorghum).
