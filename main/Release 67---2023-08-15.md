## Gramene Release 67
### Released: August 2023
## Summary

Release #67 features data updates for [Oryza CLIMtools](https://www.gramene.org/CLIMtools/oryza_v1.0/), [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments), and [Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org). The new [Oryza CLIMtools](https://www.gramene.org/CLIMtools/oryza_v1.0/) portal brings interactive web-based views of environment by genome associations, and RiboSNitch prediction for RNA fold altering variants in rice (see the [CLIMtools portal](https://www.gramene.org/CLIMtools/)). In addition, expression data from 25 plant studies was curated in collaboration with EBI’s Expression Atlas, and baseline expression (14 studies) is directly accessible through the Expression tab of Gramene’s gene search interface. Pathway updates with [Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org) include two newly curated pathways and homology-based pathway projections to 10 new species for a total of 130 species.

This release features two newly curated pathways and one "container" pathway for response to gravitropism stimuli. This adds to a total of 309 reference rice pathways. 

- Top level pathway: Response to stimuli: abiotic stresses and stimuli
- Container pathway: Gravitropism under normal or artificial gravity environments
- Newly curated: Regulation of seed germination and coleoptile growth under submergence and normal gravity environment
- Newly curated: Regulation of lemma joints development and leaf angle by cytokinin
  
In addition, we have added homology-based pathway projections for 10 new species, adding up to a total of 130 species with Plant Reactome pathways:

- _Brassica juncea_ (brown mustard)
- _Corymbia citriodora_ (lemon-scented gum)
- _Digitaria exilis_ (white fonio, fonio millet, hungry rice)
- _Echinochloa crus-gallis_ (barnyard grass)
- _Lolium perenne_ (rye grass)
- _Pisum sativum_ (pea)
- _Quercus lobata_ (valley oak)
- _Quercus suber_ (cork oak)
- _Secale cereale_ (rye)
- _Vigna unguiculata_ (cowpea or black-eyed pea)

The new pathways have been indexed and are searchable from Gramene's homepage, see for example: [Os06g0670300](https://www.gramene.org/?idList=Os06g0670300) (click on the Pathway tab), a gravitropism gene expressed during the regulation of seed germination and coleoptile growth.

The Gramene Knowledgebase is a curated, open-source, integrated data resource for comparative functional genomics in crops and model plant species. The genome databases are a mirror of EMBL-EBI Ensembl Plants, and built in collaboration with Expression Atlas, and UniProt. The homepage continues to include links to our crop specific pangenome sites for [maize](https://maize-pangenome.gramene.org/), [rice](https://oryza.gramene.org/), [grapevine](https://vitis.gramene.org/), and [sorghum](https://sorghumbase.org). These pangenome sites provide access to additional genomes from the respective taxonomic clade for comparative analysis against the primary annotated reference genome representative. The Plant Reactome database is produced in collaboration with the NIH-funded human Reactome project.

Core funding for the project is provided by the Agricultural Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA ARS 8062-21000-041-00D).

We continue to have an integrated Twitter (X) feed on the homepage. Users and readers are encouraged to follow us @GrameneDatabase to get updates, highlights and news.

## Overall Highlights {#overall-highlights}

**CLIMtools portal**

- The new [Oryza CLIMtools](https://www.gramene.org/CLIMtools/oryza_v1.0/) portal brings interactive web-based views of environment by genome associations,
  RiboSNitch prediction, and correlations between the local environment and a pool of curated rice phenotypes.
  
**New data & features**

- Gene expression data was manually curated with the [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments) for 25 new plant studies, and 14 of them (7 in maize, 5 in rice, and 2 in Arabidopsis) are directly accessible in the Expression tab of the search interface, and through the Plant Reactome site.

- New Plant Reactome pathway data is now searchable in the Gramene Search Interface, see for example: [Os06g0670300](https://www.gramene.org/?idList=Os06g0670300) (click on the Pathway tab) to see how OsMPH1 and other genes are involved in the regulation of seed germination and coleoptile growth.

**New Reactome Pathways**

- [_Brassica juncea_](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Brassica_juncea) (brown mustard)
- [_Corymbia citriodora_](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Corymbia_citriodora) (lemon-scented gum)
- [_Digitaria exilis_](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Digitaria_exilis) (white fonio, fonio millet, hungry rice)
- [_Echinochloa crus-galli_](https://ensembl.gramene.org/Echinochloa_crusgalli) (barnyard grass)

## Databases {#databases}
### Comparative Genomics

[**Gene Trees**](https://ensembl.gramene.org/info/genome/compara/prot_tree_stats.html)
A total of 152,102 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by
the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each
of 3,624,840 individual genes (5,140,091 input proteins) from 106 plant genomes.

[**Whole-Genome Alignments**](https://ensembl.gramene.org/info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html)
There are 278 pairwise genomic alignments. The majority of species in Gramene were aligned with _Oryza sativa_ Japonica (reference monocot), and _Arabidopsis thaliana_ and _Vitis vinifera_ (reference dicots).

[**Synteny**](https://ensembl.gramene.org/info/genome/compara/compara_analyses.html)
Seventy-nine paired synteny maps are available. 

[**Putative Split Genes**](http://ftp.gramene.org/CURRENT_RELEASE/splitgenes/)
Updated split genes for the current release are available on the FTP site.  These are putative gene annotation artifacts (also known as contiguous gene split models) and are based on the latest Ensembl Compara Gene Tree database. Overall statistics for each species is given in the [README](https://ftp.gramene.org/CURRENT_RELEASE/split_genes/1_ReadMe_SplitGenesBySpecies.txt).

[**Plant Reactome**](https://plantreactome.gramene.org)
Plant Reactome is the pathway knowledgebase of Gramene. We utilize the Reactome pathway data model to represent plant metabolic, transport and signaling pathways, developmental processes, organ differentiation, and transcriptional regulatory networks. Manual biocuration is conducted in the reference species rice (_O. sativa_) and pathways are then projected via gene orthology to other species including single-cell photoautotrophs, lower plants, and higher plants. This release is a maintenance release. Plant Reactome continues to host pathway projections for 120 plant species. Additional details and statistics can be found in the Plant Reactome's site [release notes](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=111&Itemid=360&lang=en).

### Protein Annotation, GO, Xref Protein domain information 

No updates in this release.


### Variation

Genetic variation data continues to be available for 17 plant species, including _Arabidopsis thaliana_, maize,  rice (Japonica, Indica, _O. glaberrima_, and _O. glumaepatula_), brachypodium, sunflower, barley, apple, tomato, sorghum, bread and durum wheat, black bean, lettuce, and cocoa. Variation for the last three species is not yet available via BioMart.


### Expression

Expression Atlas now contains a total of 1007 plant experiments. Baseline gene expression data for 23 plant genomes has been curated and processed with the [EMBL-EBI's Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/plant/experiments), and is available via Gramene's Search, Gramene's Genome Browser, and Gramene's pathways interface, the Plant Reactome. Differential expression for most of those species is available directly in the Expression Atlas website. 


### Pathways

309 manually curated Japonica rice pathways, and orthology-based pathways for 130 plant species cross-linked with [Gramene’s Plant Reactome](https://plantreactome.gramene.org/) entries.


### Gramene Mart

No updates in this release.


## Infrastructure

**Web Services:** Gramene's [web services page](https://gramene.org/web-services) documents ways to directly connect to and analyze our databases.

- Public MySQL Server: 

Our partner Ensembl Genomes offers a public, read-only MySQL server with copies of the species-specific and comparative genomic databases that we use. To use this with the mysql command-line client:

  $ mysql -hmysql-eg-publicsql.ebi.ac.uk -P4157 -uanonymous

Please note that the versioning scheme used at this public database differs from ours; Gramene's release 67_108 is set as version 55_108 at Ensembl.
