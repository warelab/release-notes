### Comparative Genomics

[**Gene Trees.**](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of 37,315 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each of 1,131,828 individual genes (1,184,741 input proteins) from 33 plant genomes.

[**Whole-Genome Alignments**](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/compara_analyses.html). Pairwise genomic alignments are available for 10 of the Oryza genomes in the Gramene website (e.g., 81 for the Japonica reference). New alignments across the Oryza genomes will be made available here in future releases.

[**Synteny**](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/compara_analyses.html). Synteny maps are available for 10 of the Oryza genomes in the main Gramene website (e.g., 19 for the Japonica reference). New synteny maps including the new rice genomes will be made available here in future releases.

### Variation

Genetic variation is available for the O. sativa Japonica and Indica references, O. glaberrima and O. glumaepatula in the main Gramene website. Genetic variation data sets will be made available here in future releases.

### Expression

Gene expression data is available only for the Japonica genome reference and was curated and processed through the EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas. The set consists of 10 studies with baseline expression (available via the Oryza Pan-Genome search interface) and 93 differential studies (only available via the Expression Atlas website).

### Pathways

320 curated pathways for the Japonica reference genome, as well as orthology-based pathway projections for the 10 Oryza species also in Gramene and the six outgroups (v5 of Zea mays only) are available via the Oryza Pan-Genome search interface and linked to Gramene’s Plant Reactome. Pathway projections for O. australiensis, O. minuta, Oryza meyeriana var. Granulata are only available on Gramene’s Plant Reactome. In addition, projections for O. longistaminata and the prior version of O. sativa indica are available on the Gramene website.
