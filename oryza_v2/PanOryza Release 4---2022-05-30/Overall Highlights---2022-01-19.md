Our comparative genomics collection was updated to include a total of 38,308 protein-coding gene family trees using Ensembl Compara software (Herrero _et al_, 2016). The new trees were constructed with 1,294,888 input proteins from 1,239,682 individual genes from the 28 Oryza genomes, _L. perrieri_, and 7 outgroup species (Arabidopsis thaliana, sorghum, grapevine, Chlamydomonas, Selaginella, B73 maize in assembly versions 4 and 5, and Drosophila).
