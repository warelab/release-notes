Gramene's Oryza Pan-Genome (https://oryza.gramene.org) is a web portal for comparative plant genomics focused on rice varieties. In its fifth release, we are providing synteny maps between rice varieties and across closely related crops, whole-genome alignments between the rice reference assembly, sorghum and maize, new links to the Oryza Search page from the Ensembl Gene pages, and updated display names for the rice genomes.
