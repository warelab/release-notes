Our comparative genomics collection was updated to include a total of 37,423 protein-coding gene family trees using Ensembl Compara software (Herrero _et al_, 2016). The new trees were constructed with 1,187,461 input proteins from 1,134,514 individual genes from the 25 Oryza genomes, _L. perrieri_, and 7 outgroup species (Arabidopsis thaliana, sorghum, grapevine, Chlamydomonas, Selaginella, B73 maize in assembly versions 4 and 5, and Drosophila) in the Oryza pan-genome.
