### Comparative Genomics

[**Gene Trees.**](https://oryza-ensembl.gramene.org/prot_tree_stats.html) A total of 37,423 protein-coding gene family trees were constructed using the peptide encoded by the canonical transcript (i.e., a representative transcript for a given gene) for each of 1,134,514 individual genes (1,187,461 input proteins) from 33 genomes.
