## Add/remove data tracks or configure an image on the genome browser {#configure-image}

Find the spider gear icon on a browser page, it might precede a "Configure this page" or have a "Configure this image" title. It might precede a phrase like "Configure this page", "Add/remove tracks" or "Select species or regions", or have the prompt "Configure this... [image]" when you mouse over it (see image below). 

When you click on it, you will be able to select or turn on/off data tracks (click on a category to disclose all the tracks under it, the number of data sets (tracks) is indicated to the right of each category). For example, there are 7 data tracks under Variation (EVA = European Variation Archive, NV = natural variation, EMS = chemically-induced point  mutations, SAP = sorghum association panel, PMID = PubMed identifier): 

- Sequence variants (all sources)
- EVA variants
- NV_PMID33452486_Lozano variants
- SAP_PMID35653240_Boatwri(ght) variants
- EMS_PMID27354556_Jiao variants
- EMS_PMID38100514_Jiao variants
- EMS_PMID29378822_Addo-Qu(aye) variants

Click on the checkbox to the left of each data set (track) to select from several options. Thus, you may choose to turn the track off or display its data in a collapsed or expanded manner, with or without labels for each data point.
