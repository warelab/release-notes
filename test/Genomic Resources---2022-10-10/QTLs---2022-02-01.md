### Phenotypic Variation - Quantitative Trait Locus (QTLs) {#qtls}
Data corresponding to 5,843 QTL features for 220 sorghum traits were imported from [OZ Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/sorghum-qtl-atlas/), and 7,123 rice QTLs from [Gramene](https://www.gramene.org/). All QTLs are now searchable, for example: [sorghum grain mold](https://sorghumbase.org/genes?filters=%7B%22status%22:%22init%22,%22operation%22:%22AND%22,%22negate%22:false,%22marked%22:false,%22leftIdx%22:0,%22rightIdx%22:3,%22children%22:%5B%7B%22fq_field%22:%22QTL_TO__ancestors%22,%22fq_value%22:%2220008%22,%22name%22:%22sorghum%20grain%20mold%22,%22category%22:%22QTLs%22,%22leftIdx%22:1,%22rightIdx%22:2,%22negate%22:false,%22showMenu%22:false,%22marked%22:true%7D%5D,%22showMarked%22:true,%22showMenu%22:false,%22moveCopyMode%22:%22%22,%22searchOffset%22:0,%22rows%22:20%7D&genomes=).

Check another [example region](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Location/View?db=core;g=SORBI_3006G095600;r=7:61190510-61277060;sv=nsv856002;svf=54084;t=OQU81659;vdb=variation) with QTLs associated with multiple traits including greenbug resistance, fresh biomass, and flag leaf height.

You may need to turn on the QTLs track and select how you would like the data displayed on your browser. For the figure shown below, I selected "Collapsed" style, which limits the dispaly to only 5 QTLs in the image. Click on a track to disclose more information about that data point (for example, QTL name, location, associated phenotype and data source). In the example below, if you click on a phenotype/trait, such as "Green bug resistance", you will be taken to a page listing all the genomic locations of QTL features associated with Green bug resistance. See an [example of such list for Panicle length](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Phenotype/Locations?ph=114).

Hint: For additional regions with QTL data in the current sorghum assembly (v.3), use the [physical or genetic (cM) coordinates](http://aussorgm.org.au/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Consensus-Map_cM-and-bp-coordinates.xlsx) kindly provided by the Sorghum QTL Atlas team.
