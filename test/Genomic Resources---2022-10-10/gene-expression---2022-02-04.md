### Baseline Gene Expression (Atlas) {#gene-expression}

Baseline gene expression data from seven sorghum BTx623 datasets curated and processed by the [EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/)
[(Emms et al. 2016; Makita et al. 2015; Davidson et al. 2012; Turco et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018; Olson et al. 2014) and
BioProject [PRJNA293229](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//bioproject/PRJNA293229)/[SRP062564](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra?study=SRP062564) by Thurber et al (2015)].

The above view depicts baseline gene expression data for a whole plant (top anatogram on the left of the results box) and for the plantâ€™s reproductive organs (bottom anatogram). Experiments are organized by study on the left side, and by tissue or developmental stage on the top of the graph. Unique data points are colored in blue, with intensity increasing in proportion to the level of expression (i.e., higher expression data points are shown in darker blue). When you hover the cursor over a data point, the data point is highlighted in yellow, a more detailed summary pops up, and the corresponding tissue is colored in pink in the anatograms. If instead, you hover over a tissue on the anatogram on the left, the name of the tissue will pop up, and the points corresponding to expression data from this tissue will light up. This feature is the product of the collaboration with the EBI-Atlas.
