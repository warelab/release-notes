*This guide demonstrates genomic resources available through SorghumBase.*

The examples below focus on MSD2, a gene which encodes a lipoxygenase (LOX) that catalyzes the first
committed step of jasmonic acid biosynthesis. For more info on this gene see [Gladman *et al* (2019)](https://www.sorghumbase.org/paper/fertility-of-pedicellate-spikelets-in-sorghum-is-controlled-by-a-jasmonic-acid-regulatory-module).
