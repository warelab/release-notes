## Structural Variation {#structural-variation}
Data for structural variation for the sorghum BTx623 reference has been imported from the
[Database of Genomic Variants Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/) (dGVA) from a single study containing around 28
thousand structural variations described by (Zheng et al. 2011). [Here is an example](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/StructuralVariation/Explore?db=core;r=1:96756-143685;sv=nsv838266;svf=32426;vdb=variation).
