## Regulation {#regulation}
RNA-Seq expression data related to root system morphology and architecture in sorghum BTx623 deposited under
BioProject [PRJNA454504](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA454504/) (Gladman et al, manuscript in prep.).
Three repetitions available for each of seven samples: leaf lower (vegetative whorl), leaf upper (growing anthesis),
panicle (upper anthesis), root bottom (anthesis), root top (vegetative), stem 1 cm (vegetative) and stem mid internode (anthesis).
- The [example](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Location/View?db=core;g=SORBI_3006G095600;r=6:46566240-46571064)
  below shows two samples with very similar patterns of gene expression for the msd2 gene region.
