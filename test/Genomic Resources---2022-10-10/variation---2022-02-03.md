## Variation {#variation}
Variation in SorghumBase is available for short variants (genetic variation, which in turn may be naturally occurring or chemically induced), longer than 50 nucleotides (structural variants) and QTL variants associated with physical traits.

### Genetic Variation

Genetic variation data for a sorghum gene is available graphically and in tabular form, and for each variant, a Variant page provides more detailed information. Below are provided examples of each of these data representations.

### Naturally occurring genetic variation - Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
Currently in SorghumBase, there are two SNPs data sets for sorghum BTx623:
- The Morris SNP dataset (Morris et al. 2013) consists of ~265,000 SNPs genotyped in 378 accessions from the US sorghum association panel (SAP).
- The Mace SNP dataset (Mace et al. 2013) includes almost 6.5 million SNPs genotyped in 45 *Sorghum bicolor* lines
  including the BTx623 reference genome plus 2 *S. propinquum* lines reported by Mace and colleagues (Mace et al. 2013).
  The data were obtained by resequencing the genomes of the 44 *S. bicolor* lines representing the primary gene pool and
  spanning dimensions of geographic origin, end-use and taxonomic group (i.e., major races of cultivated *S. bicolor*,
  landraces, improved inbreds, progenitors, wild and weedy), and the first resequenced genome of *S. propinquum*, all of
  which were mapped to the BTx623 *S. bicolor* reference genome.
### Chemically induced variation -  Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutations
Currently in SorghumBase, there is one collection of EMS-induced mutant lines. EMS is a chemical commonly used to cause point mutations, that is, to change single nucleotides in the DNA of a plant seed.
- The Xin EMS dataset (Jiao et al. 2016) includes almost 1.5 million EMS-induced G/C to A/T transition mutations annotated from 252 M3 families selected from the 6,400 sorghum mutant library in BTx623 background described by Xin and colleagues (Xin et al. 2008). Genomic DNA used for sequencing was pooled from 20 M3 plants per M2 family (Jiao et al. 2016).
