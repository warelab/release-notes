### Plant Reactome Pathways

The Plant Reactome is a manually curated and peer-reviewed pathway database focused on metabolism and regulation.
Pathways curated in _Oryza sativa japonica_ are projected via orthology to other genomes, including sorghum. As of SorghumBase release 7, there are 271 orthology-based sorghum pathways for _S. bicolor_ BTx623 (NCBIv3) imported from the Plant Reactome.

he Pathway view for sorghum genes is not currently available from the Ensembl browser. However, the view can be acessed from the search results interface from SorghumBase's front page. Thus, the [example](https://www.sorghumbase.org/genes?idList=SORBI_3006G095600) below shows the Plant Reactome Pathway viewer focused on the Sobic.006G095600 gene. This gene functions as the lipoxygenase that catalyzes the same reaction (O2 + LINOLENATE --> 13-HPOT) in two distinct parhways: jasmonic acid biosynthesis pathway, and 13-LOX and 13-HPL pathway.
