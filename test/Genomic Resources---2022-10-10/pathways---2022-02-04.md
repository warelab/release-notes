### Plant Reactome Pathways

The Plant Reactome is a manually curated and peer-reviewed pathway database focused on metabolism and regulation.
Pathways curated in Oryza sativa japonica are projected via orthology to other genomes.
- The [example](https://www.sorghumbase.org/genes?idList=SORBI_3006G095600) below shows the Plant Reactome Pathway viewer focused on the MSD2 gene in Sorghum bicolor (BTx623).
