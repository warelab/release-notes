## About *Sorghum bicolor* BTx623
*Sorghum bicolor* (L.) Moench subsp. *bicolor*, is a widely grown cereal crop, particularly in Africa, ranking 5<sup>th</sup> in global cereal production (FAOSTAT 2008; http://www.fao.org/in-action/inpho/crop-compendium/cereals-grains/). It is a C4 grass also used for sugar production, brewing, feedstock, and as a biofuel crop. Its diploid genome (~730 Mbp) has a haploid chromosome number of 10. The inbred variety ‘BTx623’ is the current reference genome for sorghum. It has short stature and an early maturing genotype used primarily to produce grain sorghum hybrids. It is a line susceptible to sugarcane aphid and sensitive to low nitrogen, and therefore often used in functional comparative studies.

BTx623 (GRIN: PI [564163](https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/accessiondetail?id=1459134)) is part of the following population panels:

- [Sorghum Association Panel (SAP)](https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/methodaccession?id1=69097&id2=494091) - 407 accessions (Casa *et al*, 2008)
- [Sorghum Bioenergy Association Panel (BAP)](https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/methodaccession?id1=310665&id2=496343) - 386 accessions (Brenton *et al*, 2016)

## Assembly
The genome assembly of *Sorghum bicolor* cv. Moench was published in 2009 (Paterson *et al*, 2009).
The present assembly corresponds to v3.1.1 at the US Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (JGI) described
in (McCormick *et al*, 2018), and is also known as the NCBIv3 assembly. Sequencing by the JGI's
[Community Sequencing Program](http://www.jgi.doe.gov/user-programs/program-info/csp-overview/)
in collaboration with the Plant Genome Mapping Laboratory at the University of Georgia, followed a whole-genome
shotgun strategy reaching 8X coverage with scaffolds -where possible- being assigned to the genetic map. JGI did
two additional rounds of improvements. The most recent update of release v3.0 included ~351 Mb of finished sorghum
sequence. A total of 349 clones were manually inspected, then finished and validated using a variety of
technologies including Sanger, 454 and Illumina. They were integrated into chromosomes by aligning to v1.0
assembly. As a result, 4,426 gaps were closed, and a total of 4.96 Mb of sequence was added to the assembly.
Overall contiguity (contig N50) increased by a factor of 5.8X from 204.5 Kb to 1.2 Mb. For more details, see
[Phytozome](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Sbicolor_v3_1_1).

NCBI accession: [GCA_000003195.3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCA_000003195.3)

## Annotation
#### Method
Gene predictions resulted from combining homology-based and ab initio methods with expressed sequences from
sorghum, maize and sugarcane, using the JGI annotation pipeline (Goodstein et al, 2012). The SorghumBase browser
presents data from the current JGI v3.1.1 release, which comprises the v3.0.1 assembly and v3.1.1 gene set
(February 2017). Read more at [Phytozome](http://www.phytozome.net/sorghum).

This is a modern annotation using resources used in the original v1.0 release (Sbi1 assembly and Sbi1.4 gene set)
and geneAtlas RNA-seq data. The main genome is in 10 chromosomes with small unmapped pieces, some of which contain
annotated genes. The NCBIv3 release (Phytozome v3.1.1) is essentially the same as Phytozome v3.1 except for 82
genes/loci that were inactivated due to 4 scaffolds entirely present in chromosome(s) that were removed.

## Regulation
#### Epigenomics
Genome-wide epigenetic marks related to root system morphology and architecture in sorghum BTx623 deposited under
BioProject [PRJNA454504](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA454504/) (Gladman *et al*, manuscript in prep.).
Three repetitions available for each of seven samples: leaf lower (vegetative whorl), leaf upper (growing anthesis),
panicle (upper anthesis), root bottom (anthesis), root top (vegetative), stem 1 cm (vegetative) and stem mid internode (anthesis).

For an example of two samples with very similar patterns of epigenetic variation for the msd2 gene region, click

#### Baseline Gene Expression (Atlas)
Baseline gene expression data from seven sorghum BTx623 datasets curated and processed by the EMBL-EBI Expression Atlas
(Emms *et al*, 2016; Makita *et al*, 2015; Davidson *et al*, 2012; Turco *et al*, 2017; Wang *et al*, 2018;
Olson *et al*, 2014) and BioProject [PRJNA293229](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//bioproject/PRJNA293229)
[SRP062564](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra?study=SRP062564) by Thurber *et al* (2015).

## Variation
Variation in SorghumBase is available for short variants (genetic variation, which in turn may be naturally occurring
or chemically induced), longer than 50 nucleotides (structural variants) and QTL variants associated with physical traits.

### Genetic Variation
Genetic variation data for a sorghum gene is available graphically and in tabular form, and for each variant, a
Variant page provides more detailed information. Below are examples of each of these data representations.

- [Image of genetic variants mapping to the smaller transcript of the msd2 gene](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Transcript/Variation_Transcript/Image?db=core;g=SORBI_3006G095600;r=6:46566240-46571064;t=OQU81659;v=tmp_6_47486074_T_C;vdb=variation;vf=3821694).
- [Table of the genetic variants mapping to the smaller transcript of the msd2 gene](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Transcript/Variation_Transcript/Table?db=core;g=SORBI_3006G095600;r=6:46566240-46571064;t=OQU81659;v=tmp_6_47486074_T_C;vdb=variation;vf=3821694).
- [Summary page of a chemically induced variant](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Variation/Explore?db=core;g=SORBI_3006G095600;r=6:46566240-46571064;t=OQU81659;v=tmp_6_47487513_G_A;vdb=variation;vf=7758800) (tmp_6_47487513_G_A).

#### Naturally occurring genetic variation
Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Currently in SorghumBase, there are two SNPs data sets for sorghum BTx623:

- The Morris SNP dataset (Morris *et al*, 2013) consists of ~265,000 SNPs genotyped in 378 accessions from the US sorghum association panel (SAP).
- The Mace SNP dataset (Mace *et al*, 2013) includes almost 6.5 million SNPs genotyped in 45 Sorghum bicolor lines
  including the BTx623 reference genome plus 2 *S. propinquum* lines reported by Mace and colleagues (Mace *et al*, 2013).
  The data were obtained by resequencing the genomes of the 44 *S. bicolor* lines representing the primary gene pool and
  spanning dimensions of geographic origin, end-use and taxonomic group (i.e., major races of cultivated *S. bicolor*,
  landraces, improved inbreds, progenitors, wild and weedy), and the first resequenced genome of *S. propinquum*,
  all of which were mapped to the BTx623 *S. bicolor* reference genome.

#### Chemically induced variation
Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-induced mutations. Currently in SorghumBase, there is one collection of EMS-induced mutant
lines. EMS is a chemical commonly used to cause point mutations, that is, to change single nucleotides in the DNA of a plant seed.

- The Xin EMS dataset (Jiao *et al*, 2016) includes almost 1.5 million EMS-induced G/C to A/T transition mutations
  annotated from 252 M3 families selected from the 6,400 sorghum mutant library in BTx623 background described by Xin
  and colleagues (Xin et al, 2008). Genomic DNA used for sequencing was pooled from 20 M3 plants per M2 family (Jiao *et al*, 2016).

### Structural Variation
Data for structural variation for the sorghum BTx623 reference has been imported from the [Database of Genomic Variants
Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dgva/) (dGVA) from a single study containing around 28 thousand structural variations
described by (Zheng *et al*, 2011). [Here is an example](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/StructuralVariation/Explore?db=core;r=1:96756-143685;sv=nsv838266;svf=32426;vdb=variation).

### Phenotypic Variation
Quantitative Trait Locus (QTLs). Data corresponding to 5,843 QTL features for 220 sorghum traits were imported from
[Sorghum QTL Atlas](https://aussorgm.org.au/sorghum-qtl-atlas/) and are provided with predicted syntenic locations in
maize and rice.

[Example region](https://ensembl.sorghumbase.org/Sorghum_bicolor/Location/View?db=core;g=SORBI_3006G095600;r=7:61190510-61277060;sv=nsv856002;svf=54084;t=OQU81659;vdb=variation)
with QTLs associated with multiple traits including greenbug resistance, fresh biomass, and flag leaf height. Hint: For
additional regions with QTL data in the current sorghum assembly (v.3), use the [physical or genetic (cM) coordinates](http://aussorgm.org.au/dev/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Consensus-Map_cM-and-bp-coordinates.xlsx)
